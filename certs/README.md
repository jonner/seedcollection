# Generate private key and certificate signing request
This is a slightly modified summary of [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self]

A private key and certificate signing request are required to create an SSL
certificate. These can be generated with a few simple commands.

When the openssl req command asks for a “challenge password”, just press return,
leaving the password empty. This password is used by Certificate Authorities to
authenticate the certificate owner when they want to revoke their certificate.
Since this is a self-signed certificate, there’s no way to revoke it via CRL
(Certificate Revocation List).

````
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:gsahdg -out server.pass.key 4096
...

$ openssl rsa -passin pass:gsahdg -in server.pass.key -out server.key
writing RSA key

$ rm server.pass.key

$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
...
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California

A challenge password []:

# Generate SSL certificate
The self-signed SSL certificate is generated from the `server.key` private key
and `server.csr` files. for rust-tls, the certificate must be a x509 v3 cert. This
can be generated by creating a `v3.ext` extensions file and passing that via the
`-extfile` option:

```
$ openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -extfile v3.ext -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
````

The contents of the v3.ext are not particularly important. For example, it can
simply be something like:

````
$ cat v3.ext
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
````
