- convert mntaxa xls file to csv
- Then convert to a format that match-species.py can understand:
  - columns: X,genus,X,species,subttype,subtaxa,native_status,rarity_status,invasive_status
- run the script and look at the output indicating not-found species
- massage the csv file a bit after comparing the missing species to the ITIS taxonomy
- re-run the script with the --updatedb option to add the mntaxa table to the db
