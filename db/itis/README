- Download ITIS sqlite database from: https://www.itis.gov/downloads/index.html
- To create a list of taxa native to minnesota:
  - convert MNtaxa xls file to csv
  - Then convert to a format that match-species.py can understand:
    - columns: X,genus,X,species,subttype,subtaxa,native_status,rarity_status,invasive_status
    - This is already done as minnesota-itis-input-modified.csv
  - run the match-species.py script with the current ITIS database and the csv file from above:
    - ./match-species.py -d ITIS.sqlite minnesota-itis-input-modified.csv
    - look at the output indicating not-found species
  - massage the csv file a bit after comparing the missing species to the ITIS taxonomy
    - For example, the taxa in the CSV is a variety (e.g. Oenothera biennis var. biennis)
      but ITIS does not recognize that variety as a valid taxon, either change
      the value in the CSV file to point to the parent taxon (e.g. Oenothera biennis)
      or simply ignore it (if the parent taxon is already included in the list)
  - re-run the script with the --updatedb option to add the mntaxa table to the db
    - ./match-species.py -d ITIS.sqlite --updatedb minnesota-itis-input-modified.csv
